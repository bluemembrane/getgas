# Get Gas

Get the gas price for 1-, 3-, and 5-minutes for specific event types on specific chains.

To use, you will have to provide your [Covalent](https://covalenthq.com) API Key to continue. If you don't have one, please kindly obtain yours [here](https://www.covalenthq.com/platform/auth/register/). After entering your API key, select the chain and then select the event type. You will then get the gas prices.

We strongly uphold security and we don't share your Covalent API key. Your key is solely used for obtaining gas prices.

This project is deployed on Vercel at [https://getgas.vercel.app](https://getgas.vercel.app).
